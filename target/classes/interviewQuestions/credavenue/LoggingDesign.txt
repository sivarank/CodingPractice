Design a logging system like syslog / event viewer. 

The logger should log the processId, name of process/application, time of event along with the actual log message. 
It should also support different types of log levels such as FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG.

=====================

1. Size of the log file 
 preserve old files
 
 
 1.evt 100 MB  
 
2. Text format 

userSessionID  


[DATETIME][ Log Level] [PID] [APP NAME] [LOG MESSAGE] \r\n



log.error("array out of bound index"); 

result: rejection
